# Cyber-Security-Questions-and-Answer

1. What is cryptography?

  Cryptography aids to secure information from third parties who are called adversaries. It allows only the sender and the recipient to access the data securely.
  
2. What is traceroute? Mention its uses.

  Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool. It helps track the route taken by a packet that is sent across the IP network. It shows the IP addresses of all the routers it pinged between the source and the destination.

Uses: 

It shows the time taken by the packet for each hop during the transmission. 
When the packet is lost during the transmission, the traceroute will identify where the point of failure is.

3. What is a firewall? Mention its uses.
A firewall is a network security device/system, which blocks malicious traffic such as hackers, worms, malware, and viruses to maintain data privacy.

Uses: 

It monitors the incoming and outgoing network traffic. It permits or allows only data packets that agree to the set of security rules.
It acts as a barrier between the internal network and the incoming traffic from external sources like the Internet.


4. What is a three-way handshake?
It is a process that happens in a TCP/IP network when you make a connection between a local host and the server. It is a three-step process to negotiate acknowledgment and synchronization of packets before communication starts. 

Step 1: The client makes a connection with the server with SYN.

Step 2: The server responds to the client request with SYN+ACK.

Step 3: The client acknowledges the serverâ€™s response with ACK, and the actual data transmission begins.
